## Project Overview

### Problem Description

People create and store an enormous amount of digital data — photos, videos, documents, and more.
Unfortunately, these memories often get lost or buried under countless files.

**Capsumi** was created to help people **preserve and categorise their digital memories** in an organised, personal, and meaningful way.

A **capsule** is a collection of digital data — including photos, videos, music, and files — locked until a specified *open date*.
Users can create personal capsules or shared ones with friends and family.
Each capsule can be customised with **themes, colours, and notes**, making it a personal experience that adds an element of **anticipation**.

## Project Goals

- Create time capsules with photos, videos, music, and files
- Enable system-wide themed capsules for each user
- Set future unlock dates (monthly, yearly, or custom)
- View active capsules in a dashboard and unlocked capsules in a timeline
- Share capsules with friends or publicly
- Focus on user memories, emotions, and social connections

Additional features may include:

- Interactive themes
- 3D animations
- Countdown animations
- Badges for engagement

## Target Users

Capsumi is made **for everyone** who wants to **store photos, videos, music, or files** in a meaningful and memorable way.
Our main audience includes **young adults and students**, but the app is open to all who value digital memories and emotional design.

## The Story Behind the Name

The name **Capsumi** comes from the word **"capsule"** — a vessel that holds memories, messages, and artifacts that tell a story over time.
The project builds on this idea, focusing on collecting and sharing **meaningful memories** that reflect personal experiences.

Coincidentally, **“Capsumi”** sounds similar to **“Capsuni”**, the Romanian word for **strawberries**.
During our Erasmus semester in Portugal, we met amazing **Romanian flatmates**, and this connection inspired our choice of the **strawberry** as our logo.

The strawberry became our own little capsule — a symbol of friendship and shared memories.
Capsumi represents preserving moments worth keeping and revisiting while staying rooted in the connections and stories that shape them.
